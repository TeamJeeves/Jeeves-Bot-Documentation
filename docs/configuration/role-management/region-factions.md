# Region/Factions

The Region/Factions integration assigns roles based on the region of a players account as well as the faction that their characters are.

## Use case

This integration could be used to show which region and faction a player has characters in. This integration would likely be used on a larger group finding server to limit people to different chat channels so they can talk to other players in their region and faction.
## Default roles

By default you will need to create roles in the following format for this integration to work.
```
NA-Horde
US-Horde
EU-Alliance
USHorde
EUHorde
```
## Custom roles

This integration allows for the setup of custom roles, rather than the roles detailed above. To use this feature you will need set a role for each region/faction combination.
