# Regions

The Region integration assigns roles based on the region of a players account.

## Use case

This integration could be used to show which region a player has characters in. This integration would likely be used on a larger group finding server to limit people to different chat channels so they can talk to other players in their region.
## Default roles

By default you will need to create roles in the following format for this integration to work.
```
EU
US
NA
TW
KR
```
## Custom roles

This integration allows for the setup of custom roles, rather than the roles detailed above. To use this feature you will need set a role for each region.
