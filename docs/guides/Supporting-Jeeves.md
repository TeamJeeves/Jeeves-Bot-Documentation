# How to support Jeeves

Jeeves support is done via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/JeevesBot). Patreon tiers unlock features of the bot.

## Tier Levels

### Jeeves Supporter

Jeeves Supporter allows access to the Patreon rank on the [Jeeves Discord Server](https://www.jeeves.bot/discord). This gives you early previews of features coming soon to Jeeves.
### Jeeves Premium

Jeeves Premium includes the Jeeves Supporter features and adds in automation for your Discord user.

Also included is the ability for a discord server of your choice to have multiple [Role Reaction](../commands/admin/rolereaction.md) channels, as well at a [Keystone Channelboard](Setting-Up-A-Board.md).
### Jeeves Premium (Server-Wide)

Jeeves Premium (Server-Wide) takes the automation features of Jeeves Premium and enables that automation for all users on a server of your choice. This also includes the multiple Role Reaction channels and a Keystone Channelboard. This tier is great for a guild discord server.
