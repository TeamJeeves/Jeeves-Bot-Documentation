## Jeeves Premium
Is our advanced automation platform. With **Jeeves Premium** we will scan you and/or your entire discord server members characters more often then default users and take the extra step of automaticly keeping their server roles up-to-date when changes are detected. 
## Tier Levels

### Friendly 

As a **Friendly** supporter of Jeeves you will have access to the patreon rank on the [Jeeves Discord Server](https://www.jeeves.bot/discord).
