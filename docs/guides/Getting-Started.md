# Getting Started

Jeeves is built to scale whether you are a small friends & family server, a large guild, or a mega Warcraft Community. Jeeves has countless configuration options to tune operation exactly as you need it. For most users our basic setup will be enough, advanced users are encouraged to fully explore our docs/webUI.

## Adding Jeeves to your server
1. Make sure you are logged in @ https://discordapp.com
2. Go to the [Jeeves](https://www.jeeves.bot) website and sign in
3. Click on the [Dashboard](https://www.jeeves.bot/dashboard) link
4. Select your server from the list **Note:** You must have the *Manage Server* permission to invite Jeeves.
5. In the window that opens, select the server in the dropdown list and click continue.
6. Leave the permissions as default and click Authorize

## First time setup
Once Jeeves is setup on your Discord server, it is recommended that you head to our website [dashboard](https://www.jeeves.bot/dashboard), select the server and look through the settings available there.

## Quick Tips

1. Don't run two or more bots with the same prefix. In the context of `!help` **!** is the prefix. These should be unique to each bot. Jeeves will allow you to change its prefix to anything you want. This can be done on the settings page of the Jeeves Dashboard
2. It is good practice to create a **Bots** or similar Role in your server that is given to all Bots. Using this you can restrict or grant permissions to all bots. Its further recommended that you create a role exclusive to Jeeves, so his permissions can be further tuned.
3. If you are using Jeeves in a managerial role such as the controlling of role assignments. Make sure Jeeves is physically ranked above any roles you want him to manage in the role list.
4. By Default Jeeves uses your Discord Server Region to determine Wow region. You can customize this in your settings, as well as override it at a channel level or per command. See the relevant command docs for more info on that.
