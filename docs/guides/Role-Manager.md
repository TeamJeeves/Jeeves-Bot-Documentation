# Jeeves Role Manager

The Jeeves role manager allows small guilds and large communities alike to effortlessly administer roles based on in-game stats and achievements. The role manager also supports the manual assignment of custom per-server roles as well as assigning a role to new members on-join.

The "Jeeves Role Manager" is broken into two segments. The user `!role` command, and the server admins `!setup RoleManager` command.

**Developer Thoughts**
>Many servers have some mechanism in place to issue custom roles. Some even require you "Apply" for a role by submitting your character info, and then a moderator manually assigns you a role based on some metric or stat. The Jeeves Role Manager seeks to use its large audience to unify the "Gimme A Role" experience across many servers.

### User Role Handler

### First Steps

Users must first add their toon to Jeeves. This is done through the !authorize command. You will be directed to https://jeeves.bot/go/auth/bnet and asked to log in to your Discord account. You'll then be prompted to allow Jeeves to access information from Battle.net about your character(s) / guild(s). This is the only information about your account Jeeves will EVER have access to.

## Getting a Role from a Integration
EZ  `!roles update` BOOM DONE

## Getting / Removing a Custom Role
In the case where the custom role is called **T Rex**
`!role T Rex`

### FAQ
##### Q) I saw a server running what appears to be an integration that's not listed here, can I use that?
>Let us know in the Discord server that you want it. We have developed a small few "private" integrations for more "specialized" community servers.
##### Q) Can you add an integration for XXXXXX?
>Maybe, let us know what you would like to see. The role manager tries to appeal to the greatest audience. If we are missing a key area, we want to hear about it.
##### Q) Jeeves says my server doesn't have the roles setup, what's going on?
>Jeeves will not create roles for you. Discord roles & permissions can be a sticky land mine, and I don't want to take responsibility for messing up your server. You create the roles, Jeeves will manage them.
