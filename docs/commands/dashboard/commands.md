# Dashboard Commands

Jeeves allows a lot of control over who can run what commands where on your discord server. Commands can also be disabled if you do not wish them to be run on your server. The commands can be controlled on a global, command category or command basis. The number of channels and roles that you can restrict to depends on your [Patreon level](../../guides/Supporting-Jeeves.md)

## Global command setting

This setting restricts all Jeeves commands to the channels and/or roles that you select. These restrictions work in combination. The user will need to be in one of the roles selected AND be in one of the channels selected in order to use any commands. Jeeves will always listen to users with server admin, no matter the channels or roles selected here.

## All command Groups

These sections allow you to restrict commands on a per group or individual command basis. An individual commands restrictions take precedence over the restrictions for the group the command is part of. Group restrictions take precedence over the global restrictions.
