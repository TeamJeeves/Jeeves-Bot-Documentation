# Pets

The Pets integration assigns roles based on the total number of pets a player has associated to their account.

## Use case

This integration could be used to show who has the most pets amongst the players are on your server, potentially opening new discussion channels.
## Default roles

By default you will need to create roles in the following format for this integration to work.
```
100+ pets
100 Pets
...
```
## Custom roles

This integration allows for the setup of custom roles, rather than the roles detailed above. To use this feature you will need set a pet count value and the role you want that value to assign. This could be used to mirror the achievements for pet collection
