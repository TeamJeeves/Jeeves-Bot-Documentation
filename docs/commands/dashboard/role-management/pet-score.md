# Pet Score

The Pets Score integration attempts to mimic the score from [warcraftpets.com](https://www.warcraftpets.com/help/#petscore) and assign roles based on this score.

## Use case

This integration could be used to show who the most pet scored players are on your server, potentially opening new discussion channels.
## Default roles

By default you will need to create roles in the following format for this integration to work.
```
1500+ Pet score
1500 Pet Score
Pet Score 1500
Pet Score 1500+
Below 500 pet score
```
## Custom roles

This integration allows for the setup of custom roles, rather than the roles detailed above. To use this feature you will need set an achievement point value and the role you want that value to assign.
