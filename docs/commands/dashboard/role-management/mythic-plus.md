# Mythic Plus

The Mythic Plus integration assigns roles based on the [raider.io](https://raider.io) score a player has.

## Use case

This integration could be used to show who the most achieved Mythic Plus players are on your server, potentially opening new discussion channels.
## Default roles

By default you will need to create roles in the following format for this integration to work.
```
2500+ Mythic Score
2500+ Mythic+ Score
2500 Mythic Score
2500 Mythic+ Score
Below 200
```
## Custom roles

This integration allows for the setup of custom roles, rather than the roles detailed above. To use this feature you will need to set a raider.io score value and the role you want that value to have. Using this you can create Keystone Explorer, Conqueror and Master roles for your server.
