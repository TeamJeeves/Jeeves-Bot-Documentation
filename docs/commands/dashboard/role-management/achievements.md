# Achievements

The Achievements integration assigns roles based on the number of achievement points a player has.

## Use case

This integration could be used to show who the most achieved players are on your server, potentially opening new discussion channels
## Default roles

By default you will need to create roles in the following format for this integration to work.
```
10000+ achievement score
10000 achievement score
Below 2000 achievement score
....
```
## Custom roles

This integration allows for the setup of custom roles, rather than the roles detailed above. To use this feature you will need set an achievement point value and the role you want that value to assign.
