# Audioperms Command AKA Audio Permissions

This command is used in conjunction with the *Restrictive* and *Selective* audio modes. For more info on these modes check out the `!setup AudioMode` command docs. Using this command you can allow or deny users access to audio depending on which mode is currently set as active.

You are able to keep a separate list of allowed/denied users between the two modes. Users who are allowed to use audio on selective mode are completely separate from users who are restricted from using audio mode when the server is in restrictive mode. This allows you to switch between the two modes when necessary with minimal effort.
