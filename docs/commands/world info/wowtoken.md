# Wowtoken Command

The Wowtoken command lets you lookup the price for the WoW token for any region with live data. The command has one optional parameter of `region:`

The `region:` parameter allows you to display the current affixes for a region other than what the default realm and region from your [server setup](../../configuration/setup.md) or [channel data](../../guides/Channel-Data.md) is set to.

`/wowtoken`

**Developer Thoughts**
>The token price fluctuates frequently and it can often be useful to have access to the pricing directly from Discord without having to navigate to a website to find that data. The token price is fetched LIVE on every request directly from Blizzard.
