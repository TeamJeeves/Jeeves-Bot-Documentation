# Wowhead-WebHook Command

The Wowhead-Webhook command allows for easy setup of the Wowhead Webhook. This will create posts for each Wowhead news article posted.

The optional `news:` parameter allows you to limit what news you are receiving. 

`/wowhead-webhook news:retail` will display news related to WoW Retail

Running this command a second time will remove the webhook setup.
