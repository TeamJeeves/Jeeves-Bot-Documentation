# Twitter Command

The Twitter command allows Jeeves to post twitter updates into the channel you run the command in.

## Follow

The Follow command tells Jeeves which Twitter accounts to post into the channel. It has one required parameter `user:`. This is the Twitter username you wish to have messages from.

You can follow as many accounts as you wish. Just enter each account individually.

`/twitter unfollow Wowhead💙`
