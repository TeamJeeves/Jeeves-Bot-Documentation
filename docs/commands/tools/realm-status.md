# Realm Status

The Realm-Status command displays the current status of World of Warcraft realms. By default it will display the realm [configured for the server](../../configuration/settings.md), but it also has the optional parameter of `realm:` that allows the status of any realm to be displayed.

### Examples

* `/realmstatus`
>  Displays the status of the realm associated with the discord server you are on. See [Dashboard Settings](../../configuration/settings.md)
***
* `/realm-status realm:Proudmoore`
>  Displays the status of the realm specified.
