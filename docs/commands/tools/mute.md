# Mute Command

The Mute command allows you to quickly mute all non-admin users in the voice channel you are currently connected to. Optionally you can specify a role with `role:` and only mute people of that role.   

`/mute` mutes all non-admins in the voice channel you are connected to.

`/mute role:@Trial` mutes all Trial role users in the voice channel you are currently connected to.

To unmute users you can use `/unmute`. This will unmute all muted users in the voice channel you are currently connected to.
