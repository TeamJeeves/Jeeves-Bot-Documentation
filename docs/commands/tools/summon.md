# Summon Command

The Summon command quickly summons a group of people based on their role to your voice channel. This will only shift users that are currently connected to a voice channel on your server to the voice channel that you are currently connected to. Jeeves can not force users to connect to a voice channel if they are not currently connected.

`/summon role:@raiders`
>  Moves all online people who hold the Raider role to your current voice channel
