# Roll Command

The roll command provides a direct imitation of the in-game roll feature. It has one optional parameter `range:`. Without `range:` roll will roll a number between 1 and 100. The `range:` parameter takes either a single number, for a maximum roll (i.e. `range:55` will roll between 1 and 55) or a range of numbers to roll between (i.e. `range:5-1337` to roll a number between 5 and 1337)

`/roll range:5-1337`
