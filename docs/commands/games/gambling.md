# Gambling Command

The gambling command allows you to play a rendition of the Popular CrossGambling addon directly in discord!



### Details

**Aliases:** `gambling`   
**Available in DM:** No   
**Can Restrict to a channel:** Yes    

**Important Note:** If your server is fairly restricted/locked down via permissions and you have elected to not make Jeeves an admin/give management permissions. Make a channel called `Gambling` prior to running this command and assign Jeeves full permissions to it including `Read Messages | Send Messages | Embed Links | Delete Messages | Manage Permissions`.

* Like most Jeeves games, gambling can be very spammy in chat. In an effort to reduce chat clutter in your server, Jeeves will only operate gambling sessions within a channel called `Gambling` if none is present he will attempt to make one.
* Once you run `!gambling` a new gambling session will be created. Follow the on-screen prompts to play!
