The trivia command is a modern rendition of the old school in-game trivia bot.

### Details

**Aliases:** `trivia`   
**Available in DM:** No   
**Can Restrict to a channel:** Yes

**Important Note:** If your server is fairly restricted/locked down via. permissions and you have elected to not make Jeeves an admin/give management permissions, make a channel called `Trivia` prior to running this command and assign Jeeves full permissions to it including `Read Messages | Send Messages | Embed Links | Delete Messages | Manage Permissions`.

* Like most Jeeves games, trivia can be very spammy in chat. In an effort to reduce chat clutter in your server, Jeeves will only operate trivia sessions within a channel called `Trivia`. If none is present he will attempt to make one.
