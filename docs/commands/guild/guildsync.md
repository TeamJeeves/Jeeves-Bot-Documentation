# Sync-Guild Command

The Sync-Guild command forces Jeeves to synchronize guild members from the armory and update users roles accordingly.

`/sync-guild`

**Note:** Warcraft only updates the Guild API once ever 3 hours, as such Jeeves attempts to automatically sync every 3 hours. Running this command does not affect the 3-hour update on Warcraft's side but will run your update early.

**Developer Thoughts**
>There have been a many times were I promote someone in game and forget to promote someone in discord as well. The same can be said for a person who joins the guild, but joins discord a few hours, or even days later. Let Jeeves worry about giving them ranks, Guild Management is hard enough.
